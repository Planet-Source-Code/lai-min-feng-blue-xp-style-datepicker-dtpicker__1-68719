### Description

I was looking to get xp style dtpicker for my project. I was surprised that no controls on internet could satisfy my need. My searches got me to 2 closest controls to what I want :

1. NeoCalendar, though this is a cool one (can change background etc), but it couldnt give me xp style that I want and anyway it's not free

2. OsenDtPicker, cool, almost all I want, but his dtpicker couldn't let user to write the date that they want (like true vb dtpicker could), user have to choose if they want to change the date.

So, I change OsenDTPicker to get user to be able to input the date manually (without having to choose calendar) and makes this control (which I would like to share with all of u).

Currently only blue xp style provided cause it's the only one I need as my project mainly used blue color.

Credit goes to Osen Kusnadi as I used his control (osenxpcombobox, osenxpspin, and monthpicker) as the start, and to gonchuki, as I used AButton (or chameleon button ?) for the xp style button
